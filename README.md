# Make NYC Streets Safe

This Repository is focused on potential changes to NYC law which would promote environmentally friendly modes of transportation (walking and cycling), and promote a safe street in line with Vision Zero initiatives around the world.

Any proposed change should have a reference for locations that are ahead of NYC in that area (the more the better), links to concrete law/ordinance/regulation (proposed or enacted) and a summary of benefits or motivations.
