# Make NYC Streets Safe

This Repository is focused on potential changes to NY and NYC law which would promote a safe street in line with [Vision Zero](http://www.nyc.gov/VisionZero) initiatives in NYC and around the world. As a byproduct these changes environmentally friendly modes of transportation (walking and cycling and mass transit) will likely increase, and private vehicle ownership will likely decrease. Changes that are directly focused on changing mode share with a side effect of improved safety may also be listed here.

Any proposed change should have a reference for locations that are ahead of NYC in that area (the more the better), links to concrete law/ordinance/regulation (proposed or enacted) and a summary of benefits or motivations.

## Get Involved

There are lots of organizations that are doing good work. Organizations that are focused on these topics are:

* [Transportation Alternatives](https://www.transalt.org/)
* [Families for Safe Streets](http://familiesforsafestreets.org/)
