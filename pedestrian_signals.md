# Pedestrian ROW

By technical definition, Pedestrian Right of Way (ROW) has been deteriorated by addition of walk signals which removed the phase where a walk signal was flashing from pedestrian ROW. Countdown clocks which can often cover a full signal to cross a 5 or 6 lane road further eroded ROW as the flashing countdown phase (which can be 30 seconds!) is no longer ROW.

This is important because it puts the burden of safety on pedestrians instead of on motorists, and in practice it stops DA's from charging RoW under other laws enacted to bolster Vision Zero <sup>[src](https://twitter.com/BicyclesOnly/status/663491830898642944)</sup>.

Motorists & cyclists can enter intersection on yellow, Pedestrians can only enter on white which puts undue safety burden on pedestrians. <sup>[src](https://twitter.com/BicyclesOnly/status/663504156041285633)</a>

If at intersection w/clock, pedestrian must get past median + 1/2 way to far curb on white, or wait @ median 4 next white. This means many intersections take multiple signal cycles to cross legally. <sup>[src](https://twitter.com/BicyclesOnly/status/663507440823046145)</sup>
