# Cyclists With Cameras

The TLC in NYC accepts reports from the general public of misconduct by drivers of Taxis and For Hire Vehicles (FHV). Based on reports it can levy fine drivers, and is willing to do so for traffic violations including blocking bicycle lanes. A growing movement to use this as a tool for increasing enforcement and improving cyclist and pedestrian safety has become known as [#CyclistsWithCameras](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CyclistswithCameras?src=hash)

## Legal Basis

There are two Laws that give the TLC authority to apply traffic laws to Taxi Drivers and For-Hire Drivers. They are TLC Commission Rule ยง55-13(a)(1) which applies to For-Hire Drivers and TLC Commission Rule ยง54-13(a)(1) which applies to Taxicab Drivers (see below).

## The TLC Report Process

http://bit.ly/TLC-Complaint or http://bit.ly/Taxi-Complaint

**"Step 1: What"** There is a description field to list the complaint. Be specific to include context on the situation, how you were affected, or your relation to the situation, and the specific complaint (it's helpful to reference the law your are complaining about), for example:

> Taxi driver stopped in bike lane, dangerously forcing bikers (including myself) into traffic lane,in violation of NYC Traffic Rules 4-08(e)(9) (no stopping in bike lane) & Commission Rule 54-13(a)(1). Pictures included.

or 

> FHV driver stopped in bike lane, dangerously forcing bikers (including myself) into traffic lane, in violation of NYC Traffic Rules 4-08(e)(9) (no stopping in bike lane) & Commission Rule 55-13(a)(1). Pictures included.

**Step 4:** Before submit you have the opportunity to review the details of your complaint. Scroll down. You can attach up to 3 files. The total size of all attachments must be under 5M, so resize as appropriate.

You will receive a confirmation page w/ your 311 report number. You will also receive an email confirmation.

The TLC will assign an investigator who will contact you (typically via phone) to review the complaint. If the investigator agrees with your complaint, the TLC will issue a summons and will notify you if the driver pleads guilty or if a hearing is scheduled

If a hearing is scheduled you will need to testify via phone.

## Keeping Notes

It's easy to get things mixed up when you file any number of complaints, so here are some tips:

* Write your complaint, the location, time of incident, and the license plate number down before submitting, and copy & paste this info into the appropriate fields when submitting your complaint. This is so you have a copy of your complaint.
* When you get the email complaint, send a copy of the email that has your 311 number to yourself (or forward to yourself) and paste a copy of your complaint text, the location, the time, and the license plate number. 
* If you have photos, attach them to the email so you have all your documentation in one place.
* When you have conversations with the TLC reply to your email thread w/ additional notes noting when you had the conversation, and what stage the complaint is in.
* If you need keep additional photos handy (and you don't want to email them) I suggest naming a folder with the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_$LICENSE`. That can also be a good spot to same your draft complaint information.
