Based on reports it can levy fine drivers, and is willing to do so for traffic violations including blocking bicycle lanes. A growing movement to use this as a tool for increasing enforcement and improving cyclist and pedestrian safety has become known as [#CyclistsWithCameras](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CyclistswithCameras?src=hash)
